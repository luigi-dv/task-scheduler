# Contributing to Task Scheduler Application

Welcome aboard! We're thrilled to have you considering contributing to the Task Scheduler Application. Your input is invaluable in making Task Scheduler Application the best it can be for everyone who uses it.

## Where to Begin?

Got a bug to report or a feature in mind? Take a quick look at our [issues](https://github.com/luigi-dv/task-scheduler-ts/issues) to see if it's already been discussed. If not, feel free to open a new issue and share all the details.

## Ready to Dive In?

If you're ready to tackle an issue or add a feature, start by forking the repository and creating a new branch with a descriptive name.

For example, if you're working on issue #325, you could name your branch something like:

```bash
git checkout -b feature-325-add-radio-buttons
```

## Bringing Your Ideas to Life

Now's your chance to make your mark! Don't hesitate to reach out if you need assistance – we're all here to support each other.

## Crafting Your Commit Messages

A well-crafted commit message is key to keeping things organized and understandable. Here's a simple structure to follow:

```text
Summarize your change in around 50 characters or less

Provide more detailed explanatory text if needed, wrapping it to about 72 characters or so. Remember, the first line is treated as the subject of the commit, and the rest is the body. The blank line separating the summary from the body is critical.

Explain the problem this commit solves and why you're making this change. Focus on the why rather than the how – the code explains that. Are there any side effects or other consequences of this change? This is the place to explain them.

Further paragraphs can be added after blank lines.

- Bullet points are okay too.
- Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded by a single space, with blank lines in between. But conventions may vary.

If you're using an issue tracker, include references at the bottom, like this:

Resolves: #325
See also: #306, #328
```

## Sharing Your Contributions

Once your changes are ready, submit a pull request for your branch. We'll review your proposal as soon as possible.

```text
Remember to replace any placeholders with actual content. For example, you might want to replace the repository URL in the "Where to Begin?" section with the actual URL of your repository.
```

We're excited to see what you'll bring to Task Scheduler Application. Let's make it even better together!
